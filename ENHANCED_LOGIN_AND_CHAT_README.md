## Organization Chat System

### Database Schema

4. **chat_attachments** - Handles file attachments
5. **chat_user_status** - Tracks online/away/busy status
6. **chat_notifications** - Manages unread notifications

### Backend API Endpoints

Created RESTful API endpoints in `/backend/src/routes/chat.ts`:

- `GET /api/chat/channels` - Get user's channels
- `POST /api/chat/channels` - Create new channel
- `GET /api/chat/channels/:id` - Get channel details

- `DELETE /api/chat/messages/:id` - Delete message
- `POST /api/chat/messages/:id/reactions` - Add/remove reactions
- `POST /api/chat/channels/direct` - Create/get direct message channel
- `PUT /api/chat/status` - Update user status
- `POST /api/chat/typing` - Update typing indicator

### Frontend Components

Created a comprehensive chat UI system:

1. **ChatInterface.tsx** - Main chat container with modal interface
2. **ChannelList.tsx** - Channel listing with create channel dialog
3. **MessageList.tsx** - Message display with reactions and editing
4. **MessageInput.tsx** - Rich text input with emoji picker and file attachments
5. **ChannelHeader.tsx** - Channel info and actions
6. **UserList.tsx** - Member list with online status

### Features Implemented

   - Soft delete with content replacement

3. **Channel Management**

   - Channel descriptions and member management

4. **User Experience**

## Setup Instructions

### Database Migration

Run the migration to create chat tables:

```bash
cd backend
npx supabase migration up
```

Or manually run the SQL in `/backend/migrations/create_chat_tables.sql`

### Environment Variables

No additional environment variables needed - uses existing Supabase configuration.

### Testing the Features

1. **Enhanced Login**
   - Navigate to the sign-in page
   - Try the "Remember Me" checkbox
   - Test password strength indicator
   - Attempt multiple failed logins to test lockout

2. **Chat System**
   - Log in to the dashboard
   - Click "Team Chat" button in sidebar
   - Create channels
   - Send messages with attachments
   - Test reactions and editing
   - Try direct messages with other users

## Security Considerations

1. **Row Level Security (RLS)**
   - Users can only see channels they're members of
   - Messages are scoped to organization
   - Users can only edit/delete their own messages

2. **Authentication**
   - All chat endpoints require JWT authentication
   - User permissions verified server-side

3. **Rate Limiting**
   - Login attempts are rate-limited
   - API endpoints have rate limiting middleware

## Future Enhancements

1. **Login System**
   - Implement actual biometric authentication
   - Add OAuth providers (Google, GitHub)
   - Two-factor authentication (2FA)
   - Enterprise SSO integration

2. **Chat System**
   - Voice/video calling
   - Screen sharing
   - Message search and filters
   - Pinned messages
   - Bot integrations
   - Mobile push notifications

## Troubleshooting

1. **Chat not loading**
   - Ensure database migrations have run
   - Check Supabase Realtime is enabled
   - Verify user has proper organization association

2. **Messages not sending**
   - Check network connection
   - Verify JWT token is valid
   - Check browser console for errors

3. **Login issues**
   - Clear browser cache/cookies
   - Check if account is locked (5 failed attempts)
   - Verify Supabase Auth is configured correctly
