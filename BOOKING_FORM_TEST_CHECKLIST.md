# Booking Form Test Checklist

## ðŸ”§ Fixed Issues

### âœ… 1. Payment Type Enum Mismatch
- **Issue**: Form was using `['Cash', 'Credit', 'To Pay', 'FOD']` but backend expects `['Paid', 'To Pay', 'Quotation']`
- **Fix**: Updated both the schema and UI options to match backend requirements
- **Files Changed**: `PremiumSinglePageBookingForm.tsx`

### âœ… 2. Branch Auto-Selection
- **Issue**: Branch wasn't being auto-selected for users
- **Fix**: Enhanced useEffect to properly auto-select based on user role and available branches
- **Logic**: 
  - Non-admin users: Auto-select their assigned branch
  - Admin users: Auto-select if only one branch or use selected branch as default
- **Files Changed**: `PremiumSinglePageBookingForm.tsx`

### âœ… 3. Backend Schema Compatibility
- **Issue**: Frontend BookingArticle interface didn't match backend requirements
- **Fix**: 
  - Made `article_id` optional for backend
  - Ensured `description` is always provided (required by backend)
  - Added proper field mapping in submit handler
- **Files Changed**: `PremiumSinglePageBookingForm.tsx`

### âœ… 4. Form Validation Logic
- **Issue**: Validation was too strict and preventing form submission
- **Fix**: Enhanced validation to check:
  - Branch validation (different branches required)
  - Customer validation (both sender and receiver)
  - Articles validation (at least one with proper fields)
  - Payment validation (including manual LR number when required)
  - Invoice validation (when has_invoice is true)
- **Files Changed**: `PremiumSinglePageBookingForm.tsx`

### âœ… 5. Zod Schema Refinements
- **Added**: Multiple validation refinements to match backend expectations:
  - Manual LR number validation
  - Branch difference validation
  - Charged weight >= actual weight validation
- **Files Changed**: `PremiumSinglePageBookingForm.tsx`
