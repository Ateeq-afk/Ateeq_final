  - Created comprehensive print template

## Test Scripts Created
1. `test-booking-lifecycle.cjs` - Comprehensive lifecycle test
2. `test-lifecycle-simple.cjs` - Simplified test using mock server endpoints

## How to Test the Complete Flow

### 1. Start the servers:
```bash
# Terminal 1 - Mock server
node server/index.cjs

# Terminal 2 - Frontend
npm run dev
```

### 2. Access the application:
- Open http://localhost:5173
- Login with superadmin credentials

### 3. Test the flow:
1. Create a new booking
2. Create an OGPL and add the booking
3. Process unloading at destination
4. Complete delivery with POD
5. Use the "Print POD" button to print the delivery receipt

## Print Functionality Details

The print system generates a professional POD document including:
- Booking reference details
- Sender and receiver information
- Delivery timestamp
- Package condition status
- Digital signature
- Photo evidence (if captured)
- Formatted for standard A4 paper

## Next Steps
- Test with real Supabase backend
- Add email functionality to send POD to customers
- Implement POD archive/retrieval system
- Add barcode/QR code scanning for faster processing
